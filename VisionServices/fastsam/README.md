# Fast Segment Anything

Official PyTorch Implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/FastSAM">.

The **Fast Segment Anything Model(FastSAM)** is a CNN Segment Anything Model trained by only 2% of the SA-1B dataset published by SAM authors. The FastSAM achieve a comparable performance with
the SAM method at **50√ó higher run-time speed**.
